# An-analysis-of-developer-interest-into-machine-learning

ABSTRACT:

Engineers, programmers, developers are using various kinds
of online forum to ask about the problems they face during
their research and development. Platform like Stack Overflow
has proven to be very successful in creating a collaborative
environment between users. Researchers are exploring the
interest of users to better explore the state-of-use of various
topics, tools and platform. In this paper we did a research to
understand the interest of users in machine learning topics
using the data from Stack Overflow. We used LDA algorithm
to model the topics and find the topics of interest from the
questions posted by users in Stack Overflow. As a result we
came to know that users are more interested in topics like
"Keras", "Tensorflow", "Neural Network" etc.
